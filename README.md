## About the Project

This program adds AI generated illustrations to books by using topic modeling 
(a part of natural language processing) to determine the central theme of each page. 
The central themes are condensed into keywords which are fed into [DeepAI]. 
This produces images that are then placed back into the pdf file. Really, this is just 
a small experiment with natural langauge processing with a fun and whimsical end product.

<!-- HOW TO PLAY -->
## Rules of Connect 4
Connect 4 is a two-player strategy game where the goal is to be the first to get four of your colored discs in a rowâ€”horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Players take turns dropping one disc at a time into a 7-column, 6-row grid. Discs fall to the lowest available space in the chosen column. The game ends when one player connects four in a row or when the grid is full with no winner, resulting in a draw.

### How to Play
Currently this game is played in the console window. Run main.py to start the game. Either the player or the computer 
is chosen at random to start. When it's the player's turn, enter a number to select a column in which to drop your piece. 
Press ctrl+c to quit at any time. Replace the AIPlayer object with another HumanPlayer object in main.py to play two player.
